    <td>Take in as much information and make my Thimble code as good as it can be</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>

    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>When my code caused the text of my Thimble to be the same as the background, I managed to find the correct answer so that it would stand out.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked questions about how to improve my code so that it was at a higher level.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I used my own knowledge from previous coding to improve.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I used knowledge that I had gained from previous lessons.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I asked many questions and raised my hand to either ask a question, or to mae a point for the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have realised that I could use my own knowledge that I have gained over the last few years when I was working on GitHub, and apply this knowledge into the work that we were doing in the lesson.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next time I will remember that I can use knowledge that I have gained from previous lessons to improve my work. I will also make sure that before getting to work on a topic, I know what I am doing so that I don't make mistakes which will make my work harder as I will have to fix my mistakes.</td>
